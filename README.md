# Project background and context
The commercial space age is here, companies like Virgin Galactic , Rocket Lab  and  Blue origin among others are making space travel affordable for everyone. Perhaps the most successful is SpaceX. SpaceX advertises Falcon 9 rocket launches on its website with a cost of 62 million dollars; other providers cost upwards of 165 million dollars each, much of the savings is because SpaceX can reuse the first stage. Therefore, if we can determine if the first stage will land, we can determine the cost of a launch. This information can be used by other rocket providers that are in competition with space X for a rocket launch. The aim of this project is to train a machine learning pipeline to predict if the first stage will land successfully

# Aim
To apply data science toolkit and machine learning in order to accurately predict the likelihood of the first stage rocket landing successfully, and thus determine the cost of a launch
